102927,102928,Twelfth Night,5.0,1.1.23,DUKE ORSINO,"And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,"

102999,103000,Twelfth Night,18.0,1.2.48,Captain,"No, not the duke's."
103000,103001,Twelfth Night,19.0,1.2.49,VIOLA,"There is a fair behavior in thee, captain,"

103003,103004,Twelfth Night,19.0,1.2.52,VIOLA,I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
103004,103005,Twelfth Night,19.0,1.2.53,VIOLA,With this thy fair and outward character.
103005,103006,Twelfth Night,19.0,1.2.54,VIOLA,"I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,"

103011,103012,Twelfth Night,19.0,1.2.60,VIOLA,And speak to him in many sorts of music
103012,103013,Twelfth Night,19.0,1.2.61,VIOLA,That will allow me very worth his service.
103013,103014,Twelfth Night,19.0,1.2.62,VIOLA,"What else may hap to time I will commit,"
103014,103015,Twelfth Night,19.0,1.2.63,VIOLA,Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.
103015,103016,Twelfth Night,20.0,1.2.64,Captain,"Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:"
103016,103017,Twelfth Night,20.0,1.2.65,Captain,"When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see."

103090,103091,Twelfth Night,39.0,1.3.69,MARIA,"A dry jest, sir."

103096,103097,Twelfth Night,42.0,1.3.74,SIR TOBY BELCH,see thee so put down?
103097,103098,Twelfth Night,43.0,1.3.75,SIR ANDREW,"Never in your life, I think, unless you see canary"
103098,103099,Twelfth Night,43.0,1.3.76,SIR ANDREW,put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit
103099,103100,Twelfth Night,43.0,1.3.77,SIR ANDREW,than a Christian or an ordinary man has: but I am a
103100,103101,Twelfth Night,43.0,1.3.78,SIR ANDREW,great eater of beef and I believe that does harm to my wit.
103101,103102,Twelfth Night,44.0,1.3.79,SIR TOBY BELCH,No question.

103105,103106,Twelfth Night,47.0,1.3.83,SIR ANDREW,What is 'Pourquoi'? do or not do? I would I had

103109,103110,Twelfth Night,48.0,1.3.87,SIR TOBY BELCH,Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.
103110,103111,Twelfth Night,49.0,1.3.88,SIR ANDREW,"Why, would that have mended my hair?"
103111,103112,Twelfth Night,50.0,1.3.89,SIR TOBY BELCH,"Past question, for thou seest it will not curl by nature."
103112,103113,Twelfth Night,51.0,1.3.90,SIR ANDREW,"But it becomes me well enough, does't not?"
103113,103114,Twelfth Night,52.0,1.3.91,SIR TOBY BELCH,"Excellent, it hangs like flax on a distaff, and I"
103114,103115,Twelfth Night,52.0,1.3.92,SIR TOBY BELCH,hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs
103115,103116,Twelfth Night,52.0,1.3.93,SIR TOBY BELCH,and spin it off.
103116,103117,Twelfth Night,53.0,1.3.94,SIR ANDREW,"Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby: your niece"
103117,103118,Twelfth Night,53.0,1.3.95,SIR ANDREW,"will not be seen, or if she be, it's four to one"
103118,103119,Twelfth Night,53.0,1.3.96,SIR ANDREW,she'll none of me: the count himself here hard by woos her.

103129,103130,Twelfth Night,57.0,1.3.107,SIR ANDREW,with an old man.
103130,103131,Twelfth Night,58.0,1.3.108,SIR TOBY BELCH,"What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?"

103140,103141,Twelfth Night,62.0,1.3.118,SIR TOBY BELCH,so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What
103141,103142,Twelfth Night,62.0,1.3.119,SIR TOBY BELCH,dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in?

103423,103424,Twelfth Night,95.0,1.5.208,VIOLA,"To answer by the method, in the first of his heart."
103424,103425,Twelfth Night,96.0,1.5.209,OLIVIA,"O, I have read it: it is heresy. Have you no more to say?"
103425,103426,Twelfth Night,97.0,1.5.210,VIOLA,"Good madam, let me see your face."
103426,103427,Twelfth Night,98.0,1.5.211,OLIVIA,Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate
103427,103428,Twelfth Night,98.0,1.5.212,OLIVIA,with my face? You are now out of your text: but

103429,103430,Twelfth Night,98.0,1.5.214,OLIVIA,"Look you, sir, such a one I was this present: is't"
103430,103431,Twelfth Night,98.0,1.5.215,OLIVIA,not well done?

103433,103434,Twelfth Night,100.0,1.5.217,OLIVIA,"'Tis in grain, sir, 'twill endure wind and weather."
103434,103435,Twelfth Night,101.0,1.5.218,VIOLA,"'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white"
103435,103436,Twelfth Night,101.0,1.5.219,VIOLA,Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on:
103436,103437,Twelfth Night,101.0,1.5.220,VIOLA,"Lady, you are the cruell'st she alive,"
103437,103438,Twelfth Night,101.0,1.5.221,VIOLA,If you will lead these graces to the grave
103438,103439,Twelfth Night,101.0,1.5.222,VIOLA,And leave the world no copy.
103439,103440,Twelfth Night,102.0,1.5.223,OLIVIA,"O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted, I will give"
103440,103441,Twelfth Night,102.0,1.5.224,OLIVIA,out divers schedules of my beauty: it shall be
103441,103442,Twelfth Night,102.0,1.5.225,OLIVIA,"inventoried, and every particle and utensil"
103442,103443,Twelfth Night,102.0,1.5.226,OLIVIA,"labelled to my will: as, item, two lips,"
103443,103444,Twelfth Night,102.0,1.5.227,OLIVIA,"indifferent red, item, two grey eyes, with lids to"
103444,103445,Twelfth Night,102.0,1.5.228,OLIVIA,"them, item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Were"
103445,103446,Twelfth Night,102.0,1.5.229,OLIVIA,you sent hither to praise me?
103446,103447,Twelfth Night,103.0,1.5.230,VIOLA,"I see you what you are, you are too proud,"
103447,103448,Twelfth Night,103.0,1.5.231,VIOLA,"But, if you were the devil, you are fair."
103448,103449,Twelfth Night,103.0,1.5.232,VIOLA,"My lord and master loves you: O, such love"
103449,103450,Twelfth Night,103.0,1.5.233,VIOLA,"Could be but recompensed, though you were crown'd"
103450,103451,Twelfth Night,103.0,1.5.234,VIOLA,The nonpareil of beauty!
103451,103452,Twelfth Night,104.0,1.5.235,OLIVIA,How does he love me?
103452,103453,Twelfth Night,105.0,1.5.236,VIOLA,"With adorations, fertile tears,"
103453,103454,Twelfth Night,105.0,1.5.237,VIOLA,"With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire."
103454,103455,Twelfth Night,106.0,1.5.238,OLIVIA,"Your lord does know my mind, I cannot love him:"
103455,103456,Twelfth Night,106.0,1.5.239,OLIVIA,"Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,"
103456,103457,Twelfth Night,106.0,1.5.240,OLIVIA,"Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth,"
103457,103458,Twelfth Night,106.0,1.5.241,OLIVIA,"In voices well divulged, free, learn'd and valiant,"
103458,103459,Twelfth Night,106.0,1.5.242,OLIVIA,And in dimension and the shape of nature
103459,103460,Twelfth Night,106.0,1.5.243,OLIVIA,"A gracious person: but yet I cannot love him,"
103460,103461,Twelfth Night,106.0,1.5.244,OLIVIA,He might have took his answer long ago.
103461,103462,Twelfth Night,107.0,1.5.245,VIOLA,"If I did love you in my master's flame,"
103462,103463,Twelfth Night,107.0,1.5.246,VIOLA,"With such a suffering, such a deadly life,"
103463,103464,Twelfth Night,107.0,1.5.247,VIOLA,"In your denial I would find no sense,"
103464,103465,Twelfth Night,107.0,1.5.248,VIOLA,I would not understand it.
103465,103466,Twelfth Night,108.0,1.5.249,OLIVIA,"Why, what would you?"
103466,103467,Twelfth Night,109.0,1.5.250,VIOLA,"Make me a willow cabin at your gate,"
103467,103468,Twelfth Night,109.0,1.5.251,VIOLA,"And call upon my soul within the house,"
103468,103469,Twelfth Night,109.0,1.5.252,VIOLA,Write loyal cantons of contemned love
103469,103470,Twelfth Night,109.0,1.5.253,VIOLA,"And sing them loud even in the dead of night,"
103470,103471,Twelfth Night,109.0,1.5.254,VIOLA,Halloo your name to the reverberate hills
103471,103472,Twelfth Night,109.0,1.5.255,VIOLA,And make the babbling gossip of the air
103472,103473,Twelfth Night,109.0,1.5.256,VIOLA,"Cry out 'Olivia!' O, You should not rest"
103473,103474,Twelfth Night,109.0,1.5.257,VIOLA,"Between the elements of air and earth,"
103474,103475,Twelfth Night,109.0,1.5.258,VIOLA,But you should pity me!
103475,103476,Twelfth Night,110.0,1.5.259,OLIVIA,You might do much.
103476,103477,Twelfth Night,110.0,1.5.260,OLIVIA,What is your parentage?
103477,103478,Twelfth Night,111.0,1.5.261,VIOLA,"Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:"
103478,103479,Twelfth Night,111.0,1.5.262,VIOLA,I am a gentleman.
103479,103480,Twelfth Night,112.0,1.5.263,OLIVIA,"Get you to your lord,"
103480,103481,Twelfth Night,112.0,1.5.264,OLIVIA,"I cannot love him: let him send no more,"
103481,103482,Twelfth Night,112.0,1.5.265,OLIVIA,"Unless, perchance, you come to me again,"
103482,103483,Twelfth Night,112.0,1.5.266,OLIVIA,To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:
103483,103484,Twelfth Night,112.0,1.5.267,OLIVIA,I thank you for your pains: spend this for me.
103484,103485,Twelfth Night,113.0,1.5.268,VIOLA,"I am no fee'd post, lady, keep your purse:"
103485,103486,Twelfth Night,113.0,1.5.269,VIOLA,"My master, not myself, lacks recompense."
103486,103487,Twelfth Night,113.0,1.5.270,VIOLA,"Love make his heart of flint that you shall love,"
103487,103488,Twelfth Night,113.0,1.5.271,VIOLA,"And let your fervor, like my master's, be"
103488,103489,Twelfth Night,113.0,1.5.272,VIOLA,"Placed in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty."
103489,103490,Twelfth Night,113.0,,VIOLA,Exit

103493,103494,Twelfth Night,114.0,1.5.276,OLIVIA,"Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions and spirit,"
103494,103495,Twelfth Night,114.0,1.5.277,OLIVIA,Do give thee five-fold blazon: not too fast:
103495,103496,Twelfth Night,114.0,1.5.278,OLIVIA,"soft, soft!"
103496,103497,Twelfth Night,114.0,1.5.279,OLIVIA,Unless the master were the man. How now!
103497,103498,Twelfth Night,114.0,1.5.280,OLIVIA,Even so quickly may one catch the plague?
103498,103499,Twelfth Night,114.0,1.5.281,OLIVIA,Methinks I feel this youth's perfections
103499,103500,Twelfth Night,114.0,1.5.282,OLIVIA,With an invisible and subtle stealth
103500,103501,Twelfth Night,114.0,1.5.283,OLIVIA,"To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be."
103501,103502,Twelfth Night,114.0,1.5.284,OLIVIA,"What ho, Malvolio!"

103505,103506,Twelfth Night,116.0,1.5.287,OLIVIA,"The county's man: he left this ring behind him,"
103506,103507,Twelfth Night,116.0,1.5.288,OLIVIA,Would I or not: tell him I'll none of it.
103507,103508,Twelfth Night,116.0,1.5.289,OLIVIA,"Desire him not to flatter with his lord,"
103508,103509,Twelfth Night,116.0,1.5.290,OLIVIA,"Nor hold him up with hopes, I am not for him:"
103509,103510,Twelfth Night,116.0,1.5.291,OLIVIA,"If that the youth will come this way to-morrow,"
103510,103511,Twelfth Night,116.0,1.5.292,OLIVIA,"I'll give him reasons for't: hie thee, Malvolio."
103511,103512,Twelfth Night,117.0,1.5.293,MALVOLIO,"Madam, I will."

103514,103515,Twelfth Night,118.0,1.5.295,OLIVIA,Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.
103515,103516,Twelfth Night,118.0,1.5.296,OLIVIA,"Fate, show thy force: ourselves we do not owe,"
103516,103517,Twelfth Night,118.0,1.5.297,OLIVIA,"What is decreed must be, and be this so."

103520,103521,Twelfth Night,118.0,,OLIVIA,Enter ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN
103521,103522,Twelfth Night,1.0,2.1.1,ANTONIO,Will you stay no longer? nor will you not that I go with you?
103522,103523,Twelfth Night,2.0,2.1.2,SEBASTIAN,"By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over"
103523,103524,Twelfth Night,2.0,2.1.3,SEBASTIAN,me: the malignancy of my fate might perhaps
103524,103525,Twelfth Night,2.0,2.1.4,SEBASTIAN,"distemper yours, therefore I shall crave of you your"
103525,103526,Twelfth Night,2.0,2.1.5,SEBASTIAN,leave that I may bear my evils alone: it were a bad
103526,103527,Twelfth Night,2.0,2.1.6,SEBASTIAN,"recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you."
103527,103528,Twelfth Night,2.0,2.1.7,SEBASTIAN,ANTONIO: Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.
103528,103529,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.1.8,SEBASTIAN,"No, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is mere"
103529,103530,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.1.9,SEBASTIAN,extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a
103530,103531,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.1.10,SEBASTIAN,"touch of modesty, that you will not extort from me"
103531,103532,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.1.11,SEBASTIAN,"what I am willing to keep in, therefore it charges"
103532,103533,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.1.12,SEBASTIAN,me in manners the rather to express myself. You
103533,103534,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.1.13,SEBASTIAN,"must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,"
103534,103535,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.1.14,SEBASTIAN,which I called Roderigo. My father was that
103535,103536,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.1.15,SEBASTIAN,"Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard"
103536,103537,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.1.16,SEBASTIAN,"of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both"
103537,103538,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.1.17,SEBASTIAN,"born in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased,"
103538,103539,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.1.18,SEBASTIAN,"would we had so ended! but you, sir, altered that,"
103539,103540,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.1.19,SEBASTIAN,for some hour before you took me from the breach of
103540,103541,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.1.20,SEBASTIAN,the sea was my sister drowned.
103541,103542,Twelfth Night,4.0,2.1.21,ANTONIO,Alas the day!
103542,103543,Twelfth Night,5.0,2.1.22,SEBASTIAN,"A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled"
103543,103544,Twelfth Night,5.0,2.1.23,SEBASTIAN,"me, was yet of many accounted beautiful: but,"
103544,103545,Twelfth Night,5.0,2.1.24,SEBASTIAN,though I could not with such estimable wonder
103545,103546,Twelfth Night,5.0,2.1.25,SEBASTIAN,"overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly"
103546,103547,Twelfth Night,5.0,2.1.26,SEBASTIAN,"publish her, she bore a mind that envy could not but"
103547,103548,Twelfth Night,5.0,2.1.27,SEBASTIAN,"call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt"
103548,103549,Twelfth Night,5.0,2.1.28,SEBASTIAN,"water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more."
103549,103550,Twelfth Night,6.0,2.1.29,ANTONIO,"Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment."
103550,103551,Twelfth Night,7.0,2.1.30,SEBASTIAN,"O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble."

103552,103553,Twelfth Night,8.0,2.1.32,ANTONIO,your servant.
103553,103554,Twelfth Night,9.0,2.1.33,SEBASTIAN,"If you will not undo what you have done, that is,"
103554,103555,Twelfth Night,9.0,2.1.34,SEBASTIAN,"kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not."
103555,103556,Twelfth Night,9.0,2.1.35,SEBASTIAN,"Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full of kindness,"
103556,103557,Twelfth Night,9.0,2.1.36,SEBASTIAN,"and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that"
103557,103558,Twelfth Night,9.0,2.1.37,SEBASTIAN,upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell
103558,103559,Twelfth Night,9.0,2.1.38,SEBASTIAN,tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court: farewell.

103562,103563,Twelfth Night,10.0,2.1.41,ANTONIO,Else would I very shortly see thee there.
103563,103564,Twelfth Night,10.0,2.1.42,ANTONIO,"But, come what may, I do adore thee so,"
103564,103565,Twelfth Night,10.0,2.1.43,ANTONIO,"That danger shall seem sport, and I will go."
103565,103566,Twelfth Night,10.0,,ANTONIO,Exit

103567,103568,Twelfth Night,10.0,,ANTONIO,"Enter VIOLA, MALVOLIO following"
103568,103569,Twelfth Night,1.0,2.2.1,MALVOLIO,Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia?
103569,103570,Twelfth Night,2.0,2.2.2,VIOLA,"Even now, sir, on a moderate pace I have since"
103570,103571,Twelfth Night,2.0,2.2.3,VIOLA,arrived but hither.
103571,103572,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.2.4,MALVOLIO,"She returns this ring to you, sir: you might have"
103572,103573,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.2.5,MALVOLIO,"saved me my pains, to have taken it away yourself."
103573,103574,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.2.6,MALVOLIO,"She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord"
103574,103575,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.2.7,MALVOLIO,into a desperate assurance she will none of him:
103575,103576,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.2.8,MALVOLIO,"and one thing more, that you be never so hardy to"
103576,103577,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.2.9,MALVOLIO,"come again in his affairs, unless it be to report"
103577,103578,Twelfth Night,3.0,2.2.10,MALVOLIO,your lord's taking of this. Receive it so.
103578,103579,Twelfth Night,4.0,2.2.11,VIOLA,She took the ring of me: I'll none of it.
103579,103580,Twelfth Night,5.0,2.2.12,MALVOLIO,"Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her, and her"

103585,103586,Twelfth Night,6.0,2.2.17,VIOLA,Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!
103586,103587,Twelfth Night,6.0,2.2.18,VIOLA,"She made good view of me, indeed, so much,"
103587,103588,Twelfth Night,6.0,2.2.19,VIOLA,"That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue,"
103588,103589,Twelfth Night,6.0,2.2.20,VIOLA,For she did speak in starts distractedly.
103589,103590,Twelfth Night,6.0,2.2.21,VIOLA,"She loves me, sure, the cunning of her passion"
103590,103591,Twelfth Night,6.0,2.2.22,VIOLA,Invites me in this churlish messenger.
103591,103592,Twelfth Night,6.0,2.2.23,VIOLA,"None of my lord's ring! why, he sent her none."
103592,103593,Twelfth Night,6.0,2.2.24,VIOLA,"I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,"
103593,103594,Twelfth Night,6.0,2.2.25,VIOLA,"Poor lady, she were better love a dream."

103805,103806,Twelfth Night,1.0,2.4.3,DUKE ORSINO,That old and antique song we heard last night:
103806,103807,Twelfth Night,1.0,2.4.4,DUKE ORSINO,"Methought it did relieve my passion much,"
103807,103808,Twelfth Night,1.0,2.4.5,DUKE ORSINO,More than light airs and recollected terms
103808,103809,Twelfth Night,1.0,2.4.6,DUKE ORSINO,Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times:
103809,103810,Twelfth Night,1.0,2.4.7,DUKE ORSINO,"Come, but one verse."

103828,103829,Twelfth Night,8.0,2.4.25,VIOLA,"A little, by your favour."
103829,103830,Twelfth Night,9.0,2.4.26,DUKE ORSINO,What kind of woman is't?
103830,103831,Twelfth Night,10.0,2.4.27,VIOLA,Of your complexion.
103831,103832,Twelfth Night,11.0,2.4.28,DUKE ORSINO,"She is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?"

103835,103836,Twelfth Night,13.0,2.4.32,DUKE ORSINO,So sways she level in her husband's heart:
103836,103837,Twelfth Night,13.0,2.4.33,DUKE ORSINO,"For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,"
103837,103838,Twelfth Night,13.0,2.4.34,DUKE ORSINO,"Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,"
103838,103839,Twelfth Night,13.0,2.4.35,DUKE ORSINO,"More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,"
103839,103840,Twelfth Night,13.0,2.4.36,DUKE ORSINO,Than women's are.
103840,103841,Twelfth Night,14.0,2.4.37,VIOLA,"I think it well, my lord."
103841,103842,Twelfth Night,15.0,2.4.38,DUKE ORSINO,"Then let thy love be younger than thyself,"
103842,103843,Twelfth Night,15.0,2.4.39,DUKE ORSINO,"Or thy affection cannot hold the bent,"
103843,103844,Twelfth Night,15.0,2.4.40,DUKE ORSINO,"For women are as roses, whose fair flower"

103850,103851,Twelfth Night,17.0,2.4.46,DUKE ORSINO,The spinsters and the knitters in the sun
103851,103852,Twelfth Night,17.0,2.4.47,DUKE ORSINO,And the free maids that weave their thread with bones
103852,103853,Twelfth Night,17.0,2.4.48,DUKE ORSINO,"Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth,"
103853,103854,Twelfth Night,17.0,2.4.49,DUKE ORSINO,"And dallies with the innocence of love,"

103917,103918,Twelfth Night,34.0,2.4.110,VIOLA,Too well what love women to men may owe:

103923,103924,Twelfth Night,36.0,2.4.116,VIOLA,"A blank, my lord. She never told her love,"
103924,103925,Twelfth Night,36.0,2.4.117,VIOLA,"But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,"
103925,103926,Twelfth Night,36.0,2.4.118,VIOLA,"Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,"
103926,103927,Twelfth Night,36.0,2.4.119,VIOLA,And with a green and yellow melancholy

104121,104122,Twelfth Night,70.0,2.5.172,SIR TOBY BELCH,I could marry this wench for this device.
104122,104123,Twelfth Night,71.0,2.5.173,SIR ANDREW,So could I too.
104123,104124,Twelfth Night,72.0,2.5.174,SIR TOBY BELCH,And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest.

104153,104154,Twelfth Night,2.0,3.1.3,Clown,"No, sir, I live by the church."
104154,104155,Twelfth Night,3.0,3.1.4,VIOLA,Art thou a churchman?
104155,104156,Twelfth Night,4.0,3.1.5,Clown,"No such matter, sir: I do live by the church, for"

104162,104163,Twelfth Night,6.0,3.1.12,Clown,but a cheveril glove to a good wit: how quickly the
104163,104164,Twelfth Night,6.0,3.1.13,Clown,wrong side may be turned outward!
104164,104165,Twelfth Night,7.0,3.1.14,VIOLA,"Nay, that's certain, they that dally nicely with"
104165,104166,Twelfth Night,7.0,3.1.15,VIOLA,words may quickly make them wanton.
104166,104167,Twelfth Night,8.0,3.1.16,Clown,"I would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir."
104167,104168,Twelfth Night,9.0,3.1.17,VIOLA,"Why, man?"
104168,104169,Twelfth Night,10.0,3.1.18,Clown,"Why, sir, her name's a word, and to dally with that"
104169,104170,Twelfth Night,10.0,3.1.19,Clown,word might make my sister wanton. But indeed words
104170,104171,Twelfth Night,10.0,3.1.20,Clown,are very rascals since bonds disgraced them.
104171,104172,Twelfth Night,11.0,3.1.21,VIOLA,"Thy reason, man?"
104172,104173,Twelfth Night,12.0,3.1.22,Clown,"Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words, and"

104175,104176,Twelfth Night,13.0,3.1.25,VIOLA,I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing.
104176,104177,Twelfth Night,14.0,3.1.26,Clown,"Not so, sir, I do care for something, but in my"

104179,104180,Twelfth Night,15.0,3.1.29,VIOLA,Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool?
104180,104181,Twelfth Night,16.0,3.1.30,Clown,"No, indeed, sir, the Lady Olivia has no folly: she"
104181,104182,Twelfth Night,16.0,3.1.31,Clown,"will keep no fool, sir, till she be married, and"
104182,104183,Twelfth Night,16.0,3.1.32,Clown,fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to
104183,104184,Twelfth Night,16.0,3.1.33,Clown,"herrings, the husband's the bigger: I am indeed not"

104187,104188,Twelfth Night,18.0,3.1.37,Clown,"it shines every where. I would be sorry, sir, but"
104188,104189,Twelfth Night,18.0,3.1.38,Clown,the fool should be as oft with your master as with
104189,104190,Twelfth Night,18.0,3.1.39,Clown,my mistress: I think I saw your wisdom there.
104190,104191,Twelfth Night,19.0,3.1.40,VIOLA,"Nay, an thou pass upon me, I'll no more with thee."
104191,104192,Twelfth Night,19.0,3.1.41,VIOLA,"Hold, there's expenses for thee."
104192,104193,Twelfth Night,20.0,3.1.42,Clown,"Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!"
104193,104194,Twelfth Night,21.0,3.1.43,VIOLA,"By my troth, I'll tell thee, I am almost sick for"

104196,104197,Twelfth Night,21.0,3.1.45,VIOLA,though I would not have it grow on my chin. Is thy
104197,104198,Twelfth Night,21.0,3.1.46,VIOLA,lady within?
104198,104199,Twelfth Night,22.0,3.1.47,Clown,"Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?"
104199,104200,Twelfth Night,23.0,3.1.48,VIOLA,"Yes, being kept together and put to use."
104200,104201,Twelfth Night,24.0,3.1.49,Clown,"I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring"
104201,104202,Twelfth Night,24.0,3.1.50,Clown,a Cressida to this Troilus.
104202,104203,Twelfth Night,25.0,3.1.51,VIOLA,"I understand you, sir, 'tis well begged."
104203,104204,Twelfth Night,26.0,3.1.52,Clown,"The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but"
104204,104205,Twelfth Night,26.0,3.1.53,Clown,a beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is
104205,104206,Twelfth Night,26.0,3.1.54,Clown,"within, sir. I will construe to them whence you"
104206,104207,Twelfth Night,26.0,3.1.55,Clown,"come, who you are and what you would are out of my"
104207,104208,Twelfth Night,26.0,3.1.56,Clown,"welkin, I might say 'element,' but the word is over-worn."
104208,104209,Twelfth Night,26.0,,Clown,Exit
104209,104210,Twelfth Night,27.0,3.1.57,VIOLA,"This fellow is wise enough to play the fool,"
104210,104211,Twelfth Night,27.0,3.1.58,VIOLA,And to do that well craves a kind of wit:
104211,104212,Twelfth Night,27.0,3.1.59,VIOLA,"He must observe their mood on whom he jests,"
104212,104213,Twelfth Night,27.0,3.1.60,VIOLA,"The quality of persons, and the time,"
104213,104214,Twelfth Night,27.0,3.1.61,VIOLA,"And, like the haggard, cheque at every feather"
104214,104215,Twelfth Night,27.0,3.1.62,VIOLA,That comes before his eye. This is a practise
104215,104216,Twelfth Night,27.0,3.1.63,VIOLA,As full of labour as a wise man's art
104216,104217,Twelfth Night,27.0,3.1.64,VIOLA,"For folly that he wisely shows is fit,"
104217,104218,Twelfth Night,27.0,3.1.65,VIOLA,"But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit."
104218,104219,Twelfth Night,27.0,,VIOLA,"Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, and SIR ANDREW"
104219,104220,Twelfth Night,28.0,3.1.66,SIR TOBY BELCH,"Save you, gentleman."
104220,104221,Twelfth Night,29.0,3.1.67,VIOLA,"And you, sir."
104221,104222,Twelfth Night,30.0,3.1.68,SIR ANDREW,"Dieu vous garde, monsieur."
104222,104223,Twelfth Night,31.0,3.1.69,VIOLA,"Et vous aussi, votre serviteur."
104223,104224,Twelfth Night,32.0,3.1.70,SIR ANDREW,"I hope, sir, you are, and I am yours."
104224,104225,Twelfth Night,33.0,3.1.71,SIR TOBY BELCH,Will you encounter the house? my niece is desirous
104225,104226,Twelfth Night,33.0,3.1.72,SIR TOBY BELCH,"you should enter, if your trade be to her."

104228,104229,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.1.75,SIR TOBY BELCH,"Taste your legs, sir, put them to motion."
104229,104230,Twelfth Night,36.0,3.1.76,VIOLA,"My legs do better understand me, sir, than I"
104230,104231,Twelfth Night,36.0,3.1.77,VIOLA,understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs.
104231,104232,Twelfth Night,37.0,3.1.78,SIR TOBY BELCH,"I mean, to go, sir, to enter."
104232,104233,Twelfth Night,38.0,3.1.79,VIOLA,I will answer you with gait and entrance. But we
104233,104234,Twelfth Night,38.0,3.1.80,VIOLA,are prevented.
104234,104235,Twelfth Night,38.0,,VIOLA,Enter OLIVIA and MARIA
104235,104236,Twelfth Night,38.0,3.1.81,VIOLA,"Most excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain"
104236,104237,Twelfth Night,38.0,3.1.82,VIOLA,odours on you!
104237,104238,Twelfth Night,39.0,3.1.83,SIR ANDREW,"That youth's a rare courtier: 'Rain odours,' well."
104238,104239,Twelfth Night,40.0,3.1.84,VIOLA,"My matter hath no voice, to your own most pregnant"
104239,104240,Twelfth Night,40.0,3.1.85,VIOLA,and vouchsafed ear.
104240,104241,Twelfth Night,41.0,3.1.86,SIR ANDREW,"'Odours,' 'pregnant' and 'vouchsafed:' I'll get 'em"
104241,104242,Twelfth Night,41.0,3.1.87,SIR ANDREW,all three all ready.
104242,104243,Twelfth Night,42.0,3.1.88,OLIVIA,"Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing."

104246,104247,Twelfth Night,44.0,3.1.91,OLIVIA,What is your name?
104247,104248,Twelfth Night,45.0,3.1.92,VIOLA,"Cesario is your servant's name, fair princess."
104248,104249,Twelfth Night,46.0,3.1.93,OLIVIA,"My servant, sir! 'Twas never merry world"
104249,104250,Twelfth Night,46.0,3.1.94,OLIVIA,Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment:
104250,104251,Twelfth Night,46.0,3.1.95,OLIVIA,"You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth."
104251,104252,Twelfth Night,47.0,3.1.96,VIOLA,"And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:"
104252,104253,Twelfth Night,47.0,3.1.97,VIOLA,"Your servant's servant is your servant, madam."
104253,104254,Twelfth Night,48.0,3.1.98,OLIVIA,"For him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,"
104254,104255,Twelfth Night,48.0,3.1.99,OLIVIA,"Would they were blanks, rather than fill'd with me!"
104255,104256,Twelfth Night,49.0,3.1.100,VIOLA,"Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts"
104256,104257,Twelfth Night,49.0,3.1.101,VIOLA,On his behalf.
104257,104258,Twelfth Night,50.0,3.1.102,OLIVIA,"O, by your leave, I pray you,"
104258,104259,Twelfth Night,50.0,3.1.103,OLIVIA,I bade you never speak again of him:
104259,104260,Twelfth Night,50.0,3.1.104,OLIVIA,"But, would you undertake another suit,"
104260,104261,Twelfth Night,50.0,3.1.105,OLIVIA,I had rather hear you to solicit that
104261,104262,Twelfth Night,50.0,3.1.106,OLIVIA,Than music from the spheres.
104262,104263,Twelfth Night,51.0,3.1.107,VIOLA,"Dear lady,--"
104263,104264,Twelfth Night,52.0,3.1.108,OLIVIA,"Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,"
104264,104265,Twelfth Night,52.0,3.1.109,OLIVIA,"After the last enchantment you did here,"
104265,104266,Twelfth Night,52.0,3.1.110,OLIVIA,A ring in chase of you: so did I abuse
104266,104267,Twelfth Night,52.0,3.1.111,OLIVIA,"Myself, my servant and, I fear me, you:"
104267,104268,Twelfth Night,52.0,3.1.112,OLIVIA,"Under your hard construction must I sit,"
104268,104269,Twelfth Night,52.0,3.1.113,OLIVIA,"To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,"
104269,104270,Twelfth Night,52.0,3.1.114,OLIVIA,Which you knew none of yours: what might you think?
104270,104271,Twelfth Night,52.0,3.1.115,OLIVIA,Have you not set mine honour at the stake
104271,104272,Twelfth Night,52.0,3.1.116,OLIVIA,And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts
104272,104273,Twelfth Night,52.0,3.1.117,OLIVIA,That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving
104273,104274,Twelfth Night,52.0,3.1.118,OLIVIA,"Enough is shown: a cypress, not a bosom,"
104274,104275,Twelfth Night,52.0,3.1.119,OLIVIA,"Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak."
104275,104276,Twelfth Night,53.0,3.1.120,VIOLA,I pity you.
104276,104277,Twelfth Night,54.0,3.1.121,OLIVIA,That's a degree to love.
104277,104278,Twelfth Night,55.0,3.1.122,VIOLA,"No, not a grize, for 'tis a vulgar proof,"
104278,104279,Twelfth Night,55.0,3.1.123,VIOLA,That very oft we pity enemies.
104279,104280,Twelfth Night,56.0,3.1.124,OLIVIA,"Why, then, methinks 'tis time to smile again."
104280,104281,Twelfth Night,56.0,3.1.125,OLIVIA,"O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!"
104281,104282,Twelfth Night,56.0,3.1.126,OLIVIA,"If one should be a prey, how much the better"
104282,104283,Twelfth Night,56.0,3.1.127,OLIVIA,To fall before the lion than the wolf!
104283,104284,Twelfth Night,56.0,,OLIVIA,Clock strikes
104284,104285,Twelfth Night,56.0,3.1.128,OLIVIA,The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.
104285,104286,Twelfth Night,56.0,3.1.129,OLIVIA,"Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you:"

104464,104465,Twelfth Night,1.0,3.4.2,OLIVIA,How shall I feast him? what bestow of him?
104465,104466,Twelfth Night,1.0,3.4.3,OLIVIA,For youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd.
104466,104467,Twelfth Night,1.0,3.4.4,OLIVIA,I speak too loud.
104467,104468,Twelfth Night,1.0,3.4.5,OLIVIA,"Where is Malvolio? he is sad and civil,"
104468,104469,Twelfth Night,1.0,3.4.6,OLIVIA,And suits well for a servant with my fortunes:
104469,104470,Twelfth Night,1.0,3.4.7,OLIVIA,Where is Malvolio?
104470,104471,Twelfth Night,2.0,3.4.8,MARIA,"He's coming, madam, but in very strange manner. He"
104471,104472,Twelfth Night,2.0,3.4.9,MARIA,"is, sure, possessed, madam."
104472,104473,Twelfth Night,3.0,3.4.10,OLIVIA,"Why, what's the matter? does he rave?"
104473,104474,Twelfth Night,4.0,3.4.11,MARIA,"No. madam, he does nothing but smile: your"
104474,104475,Twelfth Night,4.0,3.4.12,MARIA,"ladyship were best to have some guard about you, if"
104475,104476,Twelfth Night,4.0,3.4.13,MARIA,"he come, for, sure, the man is tainted in's wits."
104476,104477,Twelfth Night,5.0,3.4.14,OLIVIA,Go call him hither.

104479,104480,Twelfth Night,5.0,3.4.16,OLIVIA,If sad and merry madness equal be.
104480,104481,Twelfth Night,5.0,,OLIVIA,"Re-enter MARIA, with MALVOLIO"
104481,104482,Twelfth Night,5.0,3.4.17,OLIVIA,"How now, Malvolio!"
104482,104483,Twelfth Night,6.0,3.4.18,MALVOLIO,"Sweet lady, ho, ho."
104483,104484,Twelfth Night,7.0,3.4.19,OLIVIA,Smilest thou?
104484,104485,Twelfth Night,7.0,3.4.20,OLIVIA,I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.
104485,104486,Twelfth Night,8.0,3.4.21,MALVOLIO,"Sad, lady! I could be sad: this does make some"
104486,104487,Twelfth Night,8.0,3.4.22,MALVOLIO,"obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering, but"
104487,104488,Twelfth Night,8.0,3.4.23,MALVOLIO,"what of that? if it please the eye of one, it is"
104488,104489,Twelfth Night,8.0,3.4.24,MALVOLIO,"with me as the very true sonnet is, 'Please one, and"
104489,104490,Twelfth Night,8.0,3.4.25,MALVOLIO,please all.'
104490,104491,Twelfth Night,9.0,3.4.26,OLIVIA,"Why, how dost thou, man? what is the matter with thee?"
104491,104492,Twelfth Night,10.0,3.4.27,MALVOLIO,"Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It"
104492,104493,Twelfth Night,10.0,3.4.28,MALVOLIO,"did come to his hands, and commands shall be"
104493,104494,Twelfth Night,10.0,3.4.29,MALVOLIO,executed: I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.
104494,104495,Twelfth Night,11.0,3.4.30,OLIVIA,"Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?"
104495,104496,Twelfth Night,12.0,3.4.31,MALVOLIO,"To bed! ay, sweet-heart, and I'll come to thee."
104496,104497,Twelfth Night,13.0,3.4.32,OLIVIA,God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so and kiss
104497,104498,Twelfth Night,13.0,3.4.33,OLIVIA,thy hand so oft?
104498,104499,Twelfth Night,14.0,3.4.34,MARIA,"How do you, Malvolio?"
104499,104500,Twelfth Night,15.0,3.4.35,MALVOLIO,"At your request! yes, nightingales answer daws."
104500,104501,Twelfth Night,16.0,3.4.36,MARIA,Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?
104501,104502,Twelfth Night,17.0,3.4.37,MALVOLIO,'Be not afraid of greatness:' 'twas well writ.
104502,104503,Twelfth Night,18.0,3.4.38,OLIVIA,"What meanest thou by that, Malvolio?"
104503,104504,Twelfth Night,19.0,3.4.39,MALVOLIO,"'Some are born great,'--"

104505,104506,Twelfth Night,21.0,3.4.41,MALVOLIO,"'Some achieve greatness,'--"
104506,104507,Twelfth Night,22.0,3.4.42,OLIVIA,What sayest thou?
104507,104508,Twelfth Night,23.0,3.4.43,MALVOLIO,'And some have greatness thrust upon them.'
104508,104509,Twelfth Night,24.0,3.4.44,OLIVIA,Heaven restore thee!
104509,104510,Twelfth Night,25.0,3.4.45,MALVOLIO,"'Remember who commended thy yellow stocking s,'--"
104510,104511,Twelfth Night,26.0,3.4.46,OLIVIA,Thy yellow stockings!
104511,104512,Twelfth Night,27.0,3.4.47,MALVOLIO,'And wished to see thee cross-gartered.'
104512,104513,Twelfth Night,28.0,3.4.48,OLIVIA,Cross-gartered!
104513,104514,Twelfth Night,29.0,3.4.49,MALVOLIO,"'Go to thou art made, if thou desirest to be so,'--"
104514,104515,Twelfth Night,30.0,3.4.50,OLIVIA,Am I made?
104515,104516,Twelfth Night,31.0,3.4.51,MALVOLIO,"'If not, let me see thee a servant still.'"
104516,104517,Twelfth Night,32.0,3.4.52,OLIVIA,"Why, this is very midsummer madness."

104519,104520,Twelfth Night,33.0,3.4.54,Servant,returned: I could hardly entreat him back: he
104520,104521,Twelfth Night,33.0,3.4.55,Servant,attends your ladyship's pleasure.
104521,104522,Twelfth Night,34.0,3.4.56,OLIVIA,I'll come to him.
104522,104523,Twelfth Night,34.0,,OLIVIA,Exit Servant
104523,104524,Twelfth Night,34.0,3.4.57,OLIVIA,"Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where's"
104524,104525,Twelfth Night,34.0,3.4.58,OLIVIA,my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special
104525,104526,Twelfth Night,34.0,3.4.59,OLIVIA,care of him: I would not have him miscarry for the
104526,104527,Twelfth Night,34.0,3.4.60,OLIVIA,half of my dowry.
104527,104528,Twelfth Night,34.0,,OLIVIA,Exeunt OLIVIA and MARIA

104529,104530,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.62,MALVOLIO,Sir Toby to look to me! This concurs directly with
104530,104531,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.63,MALVOLIO,"the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may"
104531,104532,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.64,MALVOLIO,"appear stubborn to him, for she incites me to that"
104532,104533,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.65,MALVOLIO,"in the letter. 'Cast thy humble slough,' says she,"
104533,104534,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.66,MALVOLIO,"'be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants,"
104534,104535,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.67,MALVOLIO,"let thy tongue tang with arguments of state, put"
104535,104536,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.68,MALVOLIO,"thyself into the trick of singularity,' and"
104536,104537,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.69,MALVOLIO,"consequently sets down the manner how, as, a sad"

104538,104539,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.71,MALVOLIO,"habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have"
104539,104540,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.72,MALVOLIO,"limed her, but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make me"
104540,104541,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.73,MALVOLIO,"thankful! And when she went away now, 'Let this"
104541,104542,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.74,MALVOLIO,"fellow be looked to:' fellow! not Malvolio, nor"
104542,104543,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.75,MALVOLIO,"after my degree, but fellow. Why, every thing"
104543,104544,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.76,MALVOLIO,"adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no"
104544,104545,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.77,MALVOLIO,"scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous"
104545,104546,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.78,MALVOLIO,or unsafe circumstance--What can be said? Nothing
104546,104547,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.79,MALVOLIO,that can be can come between me and the full
104547,104548,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.80,MALVOLIO,"prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the"
104548,104549,Twelfth Night,35.0,3.4.81,MALVOLIO,"doer of this, and he is to be thanked."
104549,104550,Twelfth Night,35.0,,MALVOLIO,"Re-enter MARIA, with SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIAN"

104551,104552,Twelfth Night,36.0,3.4.83,SIR TOBY BELCH,"the devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legion"

104555,104556,Twelfth Night,38.0,3.4.87,MALVOLIO,"Go off, I discard you: let me enjoy my private: go"
104556,104557,Twelfth Night,38.0,3.4.88,MALVOLIO,off.

104561,104562,Twelfth Night,41.0,3.4.93,SIR TOBY BELCH,"Go to, go to, peace, peace, we must deal gently"
104562,104563,Twelfth Night,41.0,3.4.94,SIR TOBY BELCH,"with him: let me alone. How do you, Malvolio? how"
104563,104564,Twelfth Night,41.0,3.4.95,SIR TOBY BELCH,"is't with you? What, man! defy the devil:"

104565,104566,Twelfth Night,42.0,3.4.97,MALVOLIO,Do you know what you say?

104572,104573,Twelfth Night,47.0,3.4.104,MARIA,O Lord!

104591,104592,Twelfth Night,58.0,3.4.122,FABIAN,condemn it as an improbable fiction.
104592,104593,Twelfth Night,59.0,3.4.123,SIR TOBY BELCH,"His very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man."
104593,104594,Twelfth Night,60.0,3.4.124,MARIA,"Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint."
104594,104595,Twelfth Night,61.0,3.4.125,FABIAN,"Why, we shall make him mad indeed."
104595,104596,Twelfth Night,62.0,3.4.126,MARIA,The house will be the quieter.
104596,104597,Twelfth Night,63.0,3.4.127,SIR TOBY BELCH,"Come, we'll have him in a dark room and bound. My"
104597,104598,Twelfth Night,63.0,3.4.128,SIR TOBY BELCH,niece is already in the belief that he's mad: we

104599,104600,Twelfth Night,63.0,3.4.130,SIR TOBY BELCH,"till our very pastime, tired out of breath, prompt"
104600,104601,Twelfth Night,63.0,3.4.131,SIR TOBY BELCH,us to have mercy on him: at which time we will

104635,104636,Twelfth Night,80.0,3.4.164,SIR TOBY BELCH,orchard like a bum-baily: so soon as ever thou seest

104639,104640,Twelfth Night,80.0,3.4.168,SIR TOBY BELCH,more approbation than ever proof itself would have

104646,104647,Twelfth Night,82.0,3.4.174,SIR TOBY BELCH,lord and my niece confirms no less: therefore this
104647,104648,Twelfth Night,82.0,3.4.175,SIR TOBY BELCH,"letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no"
104648,104649,Twelfth Night,82.0,3.4.176,SIR TOBY BELCH,terror in the youth: he will find it comes from a
104649,104650,Twelfth Night,82.0,3.4.177,SIR TOBY BELCH,"clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by"
104650,104651,Twelfth Night,82.0,3.4.178,SIR TOBY BELCH,"word of mouth, set upon Aguecheek a notable report"

104664,104665,Twelfth Night,85.0,3.4.190,OLIVIA,"There's something in me that reproves my fault,"
104665,104666,Twelfth Night,85.0,3.4.191,OLIVIA,"But such a headstrong potent fault it is,"
104666,104667,Twelfth Night,85.0,3.4.192,OLIVIA,That it but mocks reproof.
104667,104668,Twelfth Night,86.0,3.4.193,VIOLA,With the same 'havior that your passion bears

104675,104676,Twelfth Night,89.0,3.4.201,OLIVIA,How with mine honour may I give him that
104676,104677,Twelfth Night,89.0,3.4.202,OLIVIA,Which I have given to you?
104677,104678,Twelfth Night,90.0,3.4.203,VIOLA,I will acquit you.

104691,104692,Twelfth Night,95.0,3.4.215,VIOLA,to me: my remembrance is very free and clear from
104692,104693,Twelfth Night,95.0,3.4.216,VIOLA,any image of offence done to any man.
104693,104694,Twelfth Night,96.0,3.4.217,SIR TOBY BELCH,"You'll find it otherwise, I assure you: therefore,"
104694,104695,Twelfth Night,96.0,3.4.218,SIR TOBY BELCH,"if you hold your life at any price, betake you to"
104695,104696,Twelfth Night,96.0,3.4.219,SIR TOBY BELCH,"your guard, for your opposite hath in him what"

104702,104703,Twelfth Night,98.0,3.4.226,SIR TOBY BELCH,that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death
104703,104704,Twelfth Night,98.0,3.4.227,SIR TOBY BELCH,"and sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word, give't or take't."
104704,104705,Twelfth Night,99.0,3.4.228,VIOLA,I will return again into the house and desire some
104705,104706,Twelfth Night,99.0,3.4.229,VIOLA,conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard
104706,104707,Twelfth Night,99.0,3.4.230,VIOLA,of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on
104707,104708,Twelfth Night,99.0,3.4.231,VIOLA,"others, to taste their valour: belike this is a man"

104711,104712,Twelfth Night,100.0,3.4.235,SIR TOBY BELCH,give him his desire. Back you shall not to the

104714,104715,Twelfth Night,100.0,3.4.238,SIR TOBY BELCH,"or strip your sword stark naked, for meddle you"
104715,104716,Twelfth Night,100.0,3.4.239,SIR TOBY BELCH,"must, that's certain, or forswear to wear iron about you."
104716,104717,Twelfth Night,101.0,3.4.240,VIOLA,"This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me"
104717,104718,Twelfth Night,101.0,3.4.241,VIOLA,"this courteous office, as to know of the knight what"
104718,104719,Twelfth Night,101.0,3.4.242,VIOLA,my offence to him is: it is something of my
104719,104720,Twelfth Night,101.0,3.4.243,VIOLA,"negligence, nothing of my purpose."
104720,104721,Twelfth Night,102.0,3.4.244,SIR TOBY BELCH,"I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this"

104725,104726,Twelfth Night,104.0,3.4.248,FABIAN,"mortal arbitrement, but nothing of the circumstance more."
104726,104727,Twelfth Night,105.0,3.4.249,VIOLA,"I beseech you, what manner of man is he?"
104727,104728,Twelfth Night,106.0,3.4.250,FABIAN,"Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by"

104729,104730,Twelfth Night,106.0,3.4.252,FABIAN,"of his valour. He is, indeed, sir, the most skilful,"
104730,104731,Twelfth Night,106.0,3.4.253,FABIAN,bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly
104731,104732,Twelfth Night,106.0,3.4.254,FABIAN,have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk
104732,104733,Twelfth Night,106.0,3.4.255,FABIAN,towards him? I will make your peace with him if I
104733,104734,Twelfth Night,106.0,3.4.256,FABIAN,can.
104734,104735,Twelfth Night,107.0,3.4.257,VIOLA,I shall be much bound to you for't: I am one that
104735,104736,Twelfth Night,107.0,3.4.258,VIOLA,had rather go with sir priest than sir knight: I
104736,104737,Twelfth Night,107.0,3.4.259,VIOLA,care not who knows so much of my mettle.

104744,104745,Twelfth Night,108.0,3.4.265,SIR TOBY BELCH,step on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.
104745,104746,Twelfth Night,109.0,3.4.266,SIR ANDREW,"Pox on't, I'll not meddle with him."

105151,105152,Twelfth Night,21.0,5.1.36,Clown,"Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind, one, two, three."
105152,105153,Twelfth Night,22.0,5.1.37,DUKE ORSINO,You can fool no more money out of me at this throw:
105153,105154,Twelfth Night,22.0,5.1.38,DUKE ORSINO,if you will let your lady know I am here to speak
105154,105155,Twelfth Night,22.0,5.1.39,DUKE ORSINO,"with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake"
105155,105156,Twelfth Night,22.0,5.1.40,DUKE ORSINO,my bounty further.
105156,105157,Twelfth Night,23.0,5.1.41,Clown,"Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come"
105157,105158,Twelfth Night,23.0,5.1.42,Clown,"again. I go, sir, but I would not have you to think"
105158,105159,Twelfth Night,23.0,5.1.43,Clown,that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness:
105159,105160,Twelfth Night,23.0,5.1.44,Clown,"but, as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap, I"
105160,105161,Twelfth Night,23.0,5.1.45,Clown,will awake it anon.

105164,105165,Twelfth Night,25.0,5.1.47,DUKE ORSINO,"That face of his I do remember well,"
105165,105166,Twelfth Night,25.0,5.1.48,DUKE ORSINO,"Yet, when I saw it last, it was besmear'd"
105166,105167,Twelfth Night,25.0,5.1.49,DUKE ORSINO,As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war:
105167,105168,Twelfth Night,25.0,5.1.50,DUKE ORSINO,"A bawbling vessel was he captain of,"
105168,105169,Twelfth Night,25.0,5.1.51,DUKE ORSINO,"For shallow draught and bulk unprizable,"
105169,105170,Twelfth Night,25.0,5.1.52,DUKE ORSINO,With which such scathful grapple did he make
105170,105171,Twelfth Night,25.0,5.1.53,DUKE ORSINO,"With the most noble bottom of our fleet,"
105171,105172,Twelfth Night,25.0,5.1.54,DUKE ORSINO,That very envy and the tongue of loss
105172,105173,Twelfth Night,25.0,5.1.55,DUKE ORSINO,Cried fame and honour on him. What's the matter?
105173,105174,Twelfth Night,26.0,5.1.56,First Officer,"Orsino, this is that Antonio"
105174,105175,Twelfth Night,26.0,5.1.57,First Officer,"That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy,"
105175,105176,Twelfth Night,26.0,5.1.58,First Officer,"And this is he that did the Tiger board,"
105176,105177,Twelfth Night,26.0,5.1.59,First Officer,When your young nephew Titus lost his leg:
105177,105178,Twelfth Night,26.0,5.1.60,First Officer,"Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,"
105178,105179,Twelfth Night,26.0,5.1.61,First Officer,In private brabble did we apprehend him.
105179,105180,Twelfth Night,27.0,5.1.62,VIOLA,"He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side,"
105180,105181,Twelfth Night,27.0,5.1.63,VIOLA,But in conclusion put strange speech upon me:
105181,105182,Twelfth Night,27.0,5.1.64,VIOLA,I know not what 'twas but distraction.
105182,105183,Twelfth Night,28.0,5.1.65,DUKE ORSINO,Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!
105183,105184,Twelfth Night,28.0,5.1.66,DUKE ORSINO,"What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies,"
105184,105185,Twelfth Night,28.0,5.1.67,DUKE ORSINO,"Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,"
105185,105186,Twelfth Night,28.0,5.1.68,DUKE ORSINO,Hast made thine enemies?
105186,105187,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.69,ANTONIO,"Orsino, noble sir,"
105187,105188,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.70,ANTONIO,Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me:
105188,105189,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.71,ANTONIO,"Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,"
105189,105190,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.72,ANTONIO,"Though I confess, on base and ground enough,"
105190,105191,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.73,ANTONIO,Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:
105191,105192,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.74,ANTONIO,"That most ingrateful boy there by your side,"
105192,105193,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.75,ANTONIO,From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth
105193,105194,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.76,ANTONIO,"Did I redeem, a wreck past hope he was:"
105194,105195,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.77,ANTONIO,His life I gave him and did thereto add
105195,105196,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.78,ANTONIO,"My love, without retention or restraint,"
105196,105197,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.79,ANTONIO,"All his in dedication, for his sake"
105197,105198,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.80,ANTONIO,"Did I expose myself, pure for his love,"
105198,105199,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.81,ANTONIO,"Into the danger of this adverse town,"
105199,105200,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.82,ANTONIO,Drew to defend him when he was beset:
105200,105201,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.83,ANTONIO,"Where being apprehended, his false cunning,"
105201,105202,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.84,ANTONIO,"Not meaning to partake with me in danger,"
105202,105203,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.85,ANTONIO,"Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,"
105203,105204,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.86,ANTONIO,And grew a twenty years removed thing
105204,105205,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.87,ANTONIO,"While one would wink, denied me mine own purse,"
105205,105206,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.88,ANTONIO,Which I had recommended to his use
105206,105207,Twelfth Night,29.0,5.1.89,ANTONIO,Not half an hour before.
105207,105208,Twelfth Night,30.0,5.1.90,VIOLA,How can this be?
105208,105209,Twelfth Night,31.0,5.1.91,DUKE ORSINO,When came he to this town?
105209,105210,Twelfth Night,32.0,5.1.92,ANTONIO,"To-day, my lord, and for three months before,"
105210,105211,Twelfth Night,32.0,5.1.93,ANTONIO,"No interim, not a minute's vacancy,"
105211,105212,Twelfth Night,32.0,5.1.94,ANTONIO,Both day and night did we keep company.
105212,105213,Twelfth Night,32.0,,ANTONIO,Enter OLIVIA and Attendants
105213,105214,Twelfth Night,33.0,5.1.95,DUKE ORSINO,Here comes the countess: now heaven walks on earth.
105214,105215,Twelfth Night,33.0,5.1.96,DUKE ORSINO,"But for thee, fellow, fellow, thy words are madness:"
105215,105216,Twelfth Night,33.0,5.1.97,DUKE ORSINO,"Three months this youth hath tended upon me,"
105216,105217,Twelfth Night,33.0,5.1.98,DUKE ORSINO,But more of that anon. Take him aside.
105217,105218,Twelfth Night,34.0,5.1.99,OLIVIA,"What would my lord, but that he may not have,"
105218,105219,Twelfth Night,34.0,5.1.100,OLIVIA,Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?
105219,105220,Twelfth Night,34.0,5.1.101,OLIVIA,"Cesario, you do not keep promise with me."
105220,105221,Twelfth Night,35.0,5.1.102,VIOLA,Madam!
105221,105222,Twelfth Night,36.0,5.1.103,DUKE ORSINO,"Gracious Olivia,--"
105222,105223,Twelfth Night,37.0,5.1.104,OLIVIA,"What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord,--"
105223,105224,Twelfth Night,38.0,5.1.105,VIOLA,"My lord would speak, my duty hushes me."
105224,105225,Twelfth Night,39.0,5.1.106,OLIVIA,"If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,"
105225,105226,Twelfth Night,39.0,5.1.107,OLIVIA,It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear
105226,105227,Twelfth Night,39.0,5.1.108,OLIVIA,As howling after music.
105227,105228,Twelfth Night,40.0,5.1.109,DUKE ORSINO,Still so cruel?
105228,105229,Twelfth Night,41.0,5.1.110,OLIVIA,"Still so constant, lord."
105229,105230,Twelfth Night,42.0,5.1.111,DUKE ORSINO,"What, to perverseness? you uncivil lady,"
105230,105231,Twelfth Night,42.0,5.1.112,DUKE ORSINO,To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars
105231,105232,Twelfth Night,42.0,5.1.113,DUKE ORSINO,My soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breathed out
105232,105233,Twelfth Night,42.0,5.1.114,DUKE ORSINO,That e'er devotion tender'd! What shall I do?
105233,105234,Twelfth Night,43.0,5.1.115,OLIVIA,"Even what it please my lord, that shall become him."
105234,105235,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.116,DUKE ORSINO,"Why should I not, had I the heart to do it,"
105235,105236,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.117,DUKE ORSINO,"Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death,"
105236,105237,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.118,DUKE ORSINO,Kill what I love?--a savage jealousy
105237,105238,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.119,DUKE ORSINO,That sometimes savours nobly. But hear me this:
105238,105239,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.120,DUKE ORSINO,"Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,"
105239,105240,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.121,DUKE ORSINO,And that I partly know the instrument
105240,105241,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.122,DUKE ORSINO,"That screws me from my true place in your favour,"
105241,105242,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.123,DUKE ORSINO,"Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still,"
105242,105243,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.124,DUKE ORSINO,"But this your minion, whom I know you love,"
105243,105244,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.125,DUKE ORSINO,"And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,"
105244,105245,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.126,DUKE ORSINO,"Him will I tear out of that cruel eye,"
105245,105246,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.127,DUKE ORSINO,Where he sits crowned in his master's spite.
105246,105247,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.128,DUKE ORSINO,"Come, boy, with me, my thoughts are ripe in mischief:"
105247,105248,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.129,DUKE ORSINO,"I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,"
105248,105249,Twelfth Night,44.0,5.1.130,DUKE ORSINO,To spite a raven's heart within a dove.
105249,105250,Twelfth Night,45.0,5.1.131,VIOLA,"And I, most jocund, apt and willingly,"
105250,105251,Twelfth Night,45.0,5.1.132,VIOLA,"To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die."
105251,105252,Twelfth Night,46.0,5.1.133,OLIVIA,Where goes Cesario?
105252,105253,Twelfth Night,47.0,5.1.134,VIOLA,After him I love
105253,105254,Twelfth Night,47.0,5.1.135,VIOLA,"More than I love these eyes, more than my life,"
105254,105255,Twelfth Night,47.0,5.1.136,VIOLA,"More, by all mores, than e'er I shall love wife."
105255,105256,Twelfth Night,47.0,5.1.137,VIOLA,"If I do feign, you witnesses above"
105256,105257,Twelfth Night,47.0,5.1.138,VIOLA,Punish my life for tainting of my love!
105257,105258,Twelfth Night,48.0,5.1.139,OLIVIA,"Ay me, detested! how am I beguiled!"
105258,105259,Twelfth Night,49.0,5.1.140,VIOLA,Who does beguile you? who does do you wrong?
105259,105260,Twelfth Night,50.0,5.1.141,OLIVIA,Hast thou forgot thyself? is it so long?
105260,105261,Twelfth Night,50.0,5.1.142,OLIVIA,Call forth the holy father.
105261,105262,Twelfth Night,51.0,5.1.143,DUKE ORSINO,"Come, away!"
105262,105263,Twelfth Night,52.0,5.1.144,OLIVIA,"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay."
105263,105264,Twelfth Night,53.0,5.1.145,DUKE ORSINO,Husband!
105264,105265,Twelfth Night,54.0,5.1.146,OLIVIA,"Ay, husband: can he that deny?"
105265,105266,Twelfth Night,55.0,5.1.147,DUKE ORSINO,"Her husband, sirrah!"
105266,105267,Twelfth Night,56.0,5.1.148,VIOLA,"No, my lord, not I."
105267,105268,Twelfth Night,57.0,5.1.149,OLIVIA,"Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear"
105268,105269,Twelfth Night,57.0,5.1.150,OLIVIA,That makes thee strangle thy propriety:
105269,105270,Twelfth Night,57.0,5.1.151,OLIVIA,"Fear not, Cesario, take thy fortunes up,"
105270,105271,Twelfth Night,57.0,5.1.152,OLIVIA,"Be that thou know'st thou art, and then thou art"
105271,105272,Twelfth Night,57.0,5.1.153,OLIVIA,As great as that thou fear'st.
105272,105273,Twelfth Night,57.0,,OLIVIA,Enter Priest
105273,105274,Twelfth Night,57.0,5.1.154,OLIVIA,"O, welcome, father!"

105275,105276,Twelfth Night,57.0,5.1.156,OLIVIA,"Here to unfold, though lately we intended"
105276,105277,Twelfth Night,57.0,5.1.157,OLIVIA,To keep in darkness what occasion now
105277,105278,Twelfth Night,57.0,5.1.158,OLIVIA,"Reveals before 'tis ripe, what thou dost know"
105278,105279,Twelfth Night,57.0,5.1.159,OLIVIA,Hath newly pass'd between this youth and me.

105286,105287,Twelfth Night,58.0,5.1.167,Priest,I have travell'd but two hours.
105287,105288,Twelfth Night,59.0,5.1.168,DUKE ORSINO,O thou dissembling cub! what wilt thou be
105288,105289,Twelfth Night,59.0,5.1.169,DUKE ORSINO,When time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case?
105289,105290,Twelfth Night,59.0,5.1.170,DUKE ORSINO,"Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow,"
105290,105291,Twelfth Night,59.0,5.1.171,DUKE ORSINO,That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?
105291,105292,Twelfth Night,59.0,5.1.172,DUKE ORSINO,"Farewell, and take her, but direct thy feet"
105292,105293,Twelfth Night,59.0,5.1.173,DUKE ORSINO,Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.

105299,105300,Twelfth Night,63.0,5.1.179,OLIVIA,What's the matter?
105300,105301,Twelfth Night,64.0,5.1.180,SIR ANDREW,He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby
105301,105302,Twelfth Night,64.0,5.1.181,SIR ANDREW,"a bloody coxcomb too: for the love of God, your"
105302,105303,Twelfth Night,64.0,5.1.182,SIR ANDREW,help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home.
105303,105304,Twelfth Night,65.0,5.1.183,OLIVIA,"Who has done this, Sir Andrew?"
105304,105305,Twelfth Night,66.0,5.1.184,SIR ANDREW,"The count's gentleman, one Cesario: we took him for"
105305,105306,Twelfth Night,66.0,5.1.185,SIR ANDREW,"a coward, but he's the very devil incardinate."
105306,105307,Twelfth Night,67.0,5.1.186,DUKE ORSINO,"My gentleman, Cesario?"
105307,105308,Twelfth Night,68.0,5.1.187,SIR ANDREW,"'Od's lifelings, here he is! You broke my head for"

105309,105310,Twelfth Night,68.0,5.1.189,SIR ANDREW,by Sir Toby.
105310,105311,Twelfth Night,69.0,5.1.190,VIOLA,Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you:
105311,105312,Twelfth Night,69.0,5.1.191,VIOLA,"You drew your sword upon me without cause,"
105312,105313,Twelfth Night,69.0,5.1.192,VIOLA,"But I bespoke you fair, and hurt you not."
105313,105314,Twelfth Night,70.0,5.1.193,SIR ANDREW,"If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me: I"
105314,105315,Twelfth Night,70.0,5.1.194,SIR ANDREW,think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.

105318,105319,Twelfth Night,70.0,5.1.197,SIR ANDREW,tickled you othergates than he did.
105319,105320,Twelfth Night,71.0,5.1.198,DUKE ORSINO,"How now, gentleman! how is't with you?"
105320,105321,Twelfth Night,72.0,5.1.199,SIR TOBY BELCH,"That's all one: has hurt me, and there's the end"
105321,105322,Twelfth Night,72.0,5.1.200,SIR TOBY BELCH,"on't. Sot, didst see Dick surgeon, sot?"
105322,105323,Twelfth Night,73.0,5.1.201,Clown,"O, he's drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone, his eyes"
105323,105324,Twelfth Night,73.0,5.1.202,Clown,were set at eight i' the morning.
105324,105325,Twelfth Night,74.0,5.1.203,SIR TOBY BELCH,"Then he's a rogue, and a passy measures panyn: I"
105325,105326,Twelfth Night,74.0,5.1.204,SIR TOBY BELCH,hate a drunken rogue.
105326,105327,Twelfth Night,75.0,5.1.205,OLIVIA,Away with him! Who hath made this havoc with them?
105327,105328,Twelfth Night,76.0,5.1.206,SIR ANDREW,"I'll help you, Sir Toby, because well be dressed together."
105328,105329,Twelfth Night,77.0,5.1.207,SIR TOBY BELCH,Will you help? an ass-head and a coxcomb and a
105329,105330,Twelfth Night,77.0,5.1.208,SIR TOBY BELCH,"knave, a thin-faced knave, a gull!"
105330,105331,Twelfth Night,78.0,5.1.209,OLIVIA,"Get him to bed, and let his hurt be look'd to."
105331,105332,Twelfth Night,78.0,,OLIVIA,"Exeunt Clown, FABIAN, SIR TOBY BELCH, and SIR ANDREW"
105332,105333,Twelfth Night,78.0,,OLIVIA,Enter SEBASTIAN
105333,105334,Twelfth Night,79.0,5.1.210,SEBASTIAN,"I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman:"
105334,105335,Twelfth Night,79.0,5.1.211,SEBASTIAN,"But, had it been the brother of my blood,"
105335,105336,Twelfth Night,79.0,5.1.212,SEBASTIAN,I must have done no less with wit and safety.
105336,105337,Twelfth Night,79.0,5.1.213,SEBASTIAN,"You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that"
105337,105338,Twelfth Night,79.0,5.1.214,SEBASTIAN,I do perceive it hath offended you:
105338,105339,Twelfth Night,79.0,5.1.215,SEBASTIAN,"Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows"
105339,105340,Twelfth Night,79.0,5.1.216,SEBASTIAN,We made each other but so late ago.
105340,105341,Twelfth Night,80.0,5.1.217,DUKE ORSINO,"One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons,"
105341,105342,Twelfth Night,80.0,5.1.218,DUKE ORSINO,"A natural perspective, that is and is not!"
105342,105343,Twelfth Night,81.0,5.1.219,SEBASTIAN,"Antonio, O my dear Antonio!"
105343,105344,Twelfth Night,81.0,5.1.220,SEBASTIAN,"How have the hours rack'd and tortured me,"
105344,105345,Twelfth Night,81.0,5.1.221,SEBASTIAN,Since I have lost thee!
105345,105346,Twelfth Night,82.0,5.1.222,ANTONIO,Sebastian are you?
105346,105347,Twelfth Night,83.0,5.1.223,SEBASTIAN,"Fear'st thou that, Antonio?"
105347,105348,Twelfth Night,84.0,5.1.224,ANTONIO,How have you made division of yourself?
105348,105349,Twelfth Night,84.0,5.1.225,ANTONIO,"An apple, cleft in two, is not more twin"
105349,105350,Twelfth Night,84.0,5.1.226,ANTONIO,Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?
105350,105351,Twelfth Night,85.0,5.1.227,OLIVIA,Most wonderful!
105351,105352,Twelfth Night,86.0,5.1.228,SEBASTIAN,"Do I stand there? I never had a brother,"
105352,105353,Twelfth Night,86.0,5.1.229,SEBASTIAN,"Nor can there be that deity in my nature,"
105353,105354,Twelfth Night,86.0,5.1.230,SEBASTIAN,"Of here and every where. I had a sister,"
105354,105355,Twelfth Night,86.0,5.1.231,SEBASTIAN,Whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd.
105355,105356,Twelfth Night,86.0,5.1.232,SEBASTIAN,"Of charity, what kin are you to me?"
105356,105357,Twelfth Night,86.0,5.1.233,SEBASTIAN,What countryman? what name? what parentage?
105357,105358,Twelfth Night,87.0,5.1.234,VIOLA,"Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father,"
105358,105359,Twelfth Night,87.0,5.1.235,VIOLA,"Such a Sebastian was my brother too,"
105359,105360,Twelfth Night,87.0,5.1.236,VIOLA,So went he suited to his watery tomb:
105360,105361,Twelfth Night,87.0,5.1.237,VIOLA,If spirits can assume both form and suit
105361,105362,Twelfth Night,87.0,5.1.238,VIOLA,You come to fright us.
105362,105363,Twelfth Night,88.0,5.1.239,SEBASTIAN,"A spirit I am indeed,"
105363,105364,Twelfth Night,88.0,5.1.240,SEBASTIAN,But am in that dimension grossly clad
105364,105365,Twelfth Night,88.0,5.1.241,SEBASTIAN,Which from the womb I did participate.
105365,105366,Twelfth Night,88.0,5.1.242,SEBASTIAN,"Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,"
105366,105367,Twelfth Night,88.0,5.1.243,SEBASTIAN,"I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,"
105367,105368,Twelfth Night,88.0,5.1.244,SEBASTIAN,"And say 'Thrice-welcome, drowned Viola!'"
105368,105369,Twelfth Night,89.0,5.1.245,VIOLA,My father had a mole upon his brow.
105369,105370,Twelfth Night,90.0,5.1.246,SEBASTIAN,And so had mine.
105370,105371,Twelfth Night,91.0,5.1.247,VIOLA,And died that day when Viola from her birth
105371,105372,Twelfth Night,91.0,5.1.248,VIOLA,Had number'd thirteen years.
105372,105373,Twelfth Night,92.0,5.1.249,SEBASTIAN,"O, that record is lively in my soul!"
105373,105374,Twelfth Night,92.0,5.1.250,SEBASTIAN,He finished indeed his mortal act
105374,105375,Twelfth Night,92.0,5.1.251,SEBASTIAN,That day that made my sister thirteen years.
105375,105376,Twelfth Night,93.0,5.1.252,VIOLA,If nothing lets to make us happy both
105376,105377,Twelfth Night,93.0,5.1.253,VIOLA,"But this my masculine usurp'd attire,"
105377,105378,Twelfth Night,93.0,5.1.254,VIOLA,Do not embrace me till each circumstance
105378,105379,Twelfth Night,93.0,5.1.255,VIOLA,"Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump"
105379,105380,Twelfth Night,93.0,5.1.256,VIOLA,"That I am Viola: which to confirm,"
105380,105381,Twelfth Night,93.0,5.1.257,VIOLA,"I'll bring you to a captain in this town,"
105381,105382,Twelfth Night,93.0,5.1.258,VIOLA,"Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help"
105382,105383,Twelfth Night,93.0,5.1.259,VIOLA,I was preserved to serve this noble count.
105383,105384,Twelfth Night,93.0,5.1.260,VIOLA,All the occurrence of my fortune since
105384,105385,Twelfth Night,93.0,5.1.261,VIOLA,Hath been between this lady and this lord.
105385,105386,Twelfth Night,94.0,5.1.262,SEBASTIAN,"[To OLIVIA]  So comes it, lady, you have been mistook:"
105386,105387,Twelfth Night,94.0,5.1.263,SEBASTIAN,But nature to her bias drew in that.
105387,105388,Twelfth Night,94.0,5.1.264,SEBASTIAN,"You would have been contracted to a maid,"
105388,105389,Twelfth Night,94.0,5.1.265,SEBASTIAN,"Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,"
105389,105390,Twelfth Night,94.0,5.1.266,SEBASTIAN,You are betroth'd both to a maid and man.
105390,105391,Twelfth Night,95.0,5.1.267,DUKE ORSINO,"Be not amazed, right noble is his blood."
105391,105392,Twelfth Night,95.0,5.1.268,DUKE ORSINO,"If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,"
105392,105393,Twelfth Night,95.0,5.1.269,DUKE ORSINO,I shall have share in this most happy wreck.
105393,105394,Twelfth Night,95.0,,DUKE ORSINO,To VIOLA
105394,105395,Twelfth Night,95.0,5.1.270,DUKE ORSINO,"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times"
105395,105396,Twelfth Night,95.0,5.1.271,DUKE ORSINO,Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.
105396,105397,Twelfth Night,96.0,5.1.272,VIOLA,"And all those sayings will I overswear,"
105397,105398,Twelfth Night,96.0,5.1.273,VIOLA,And those swearings keep as true in soul
105398,105399,Twelfth Night,96.0,5.1.274,VIOLA,As doth that orbed continent the fire
105399,105400,Twelfth Night,96.0,5.1.275,VIOLA,That severs day from night.
105400,105401,Twelfth Night,97.0,5.1.276,DUKE ORSINO,"Give me thy hand,"
105401,105402,Twelfth Night,97.0,5.1.277,DUKE ORSINO,And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.
105402,105403,Twelfth Night,98.0,5.1.278,VIOLA,The captain that did bring me first on shore
105403,105404,Twelfth Night,98.0,5.1.279,VIOLA,Hath my maid's garments: he upon some action
105404,105405,Twelfth Night,98.0,5.1.280,VIOLA,"Is now in durance, at Malvolio's suit,"
105405,105406,Twelfth Night,98.0,5.1.281,VIOLA,"A gentleman, and follower of my lady's."
105406,105407,Twelfth Night,99.0,5.1.282,OLIVIA,He shall enlarge him: fetch Malvolio hither:
105407,105408,Twelfth Night,99.0,5.1.283,OLIVIA,"And yet, alas, now I remember me,"
105408,105409,Twelfth Night,99.0,5.1.284,OLIVIA,"They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract."
105409,105410,Twelfth Night,99.0,,OLIVIA,"Re-enter Clown with a letter, and FABIAN"
105410,105411,Twelfth Night,99.0,5.1.285,OLIVIA,A most extracting frenzy of mine own
105411,105412,Twelfth Night,99.0,5.1.286,OLIVIA,From my remembrance clearly banish'd his.
105412,105413,Twelfth Night,99.0,5.1.287,OLIVIA,"How does he, sirrah?"
105413,105414,Twelfth Night,100.0,5.1.288,Clown,"Truly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the staves's end as"
105414,105415,Twelfth Night,100.0,5.1.289,Clown,well as a man in his case may do: has here writ a
105415,105416,Twelfth Night,100.0,5.1.290,Clown,"letter to you, I should have given't you to-day"
105416,105417,Twelfth Night,100.0,5.1.291,Clown,"morning, but as a madman's epistles are no gospels,"
105417,105418,Twelfth Night,100.0,5.1.292,Clown,so it skills not much when they are delivered.
105418,105419,Twelfth Night,101.0,5.1.293,OLIVIA,"Open't, and read it."
105419,105420,Twelfth Night,102.0,5.1.294,Clown,Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers
105420,105421,Twelfth Night,102.0,5.1.295,Clown,the madman.
105421,105422,Twelfth Night,102.0,,Clown,Reads
105422,105423,Twelfth Night,102.0,5.1.296,Clown,"'By the Lord, madam,'--"
105423,105424,Twelfth Night,103.0,5.1.297,OLIVIA,How now! art thou mad?
105424,105425,Twelfth Night,104.0,5.1.298,Clown,"No, madam, I do but read madness: an your ladyship"
105425,105426,Twelfth Night,104.0,5.1.299,Clown,"will have it as it ought to be, you must allow Vox."
105426,105427,Twelfth Night,105.0,5.1.300,OLIVIA,"Prithee, read i' thy right wits."
105427,105428,Twelfth Night,106.0,5.1.301,Clown,"So I do, madonna, but to read his right wits is to"
105428,105429,Twelfth Night,106.0,5.1.302,Clown,"read thus: therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear."
105429,105430,Twelfth Night,107.0,5.1.303,OLIVIA,"Read it you, sirrah."
105430,105431,Twelfth Night,107.0,,OLIVIA,To FABIAN
105431,105432,Twelfth Night,108.0,5.1.304,FABIAN,"[Reads]  'By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the"
105432,105433,Twelfth Night,108.0,5.1.305,FABIAN,world shall know it: though you have put me into

105434,105435,Twelfth Night,108.0,5.1.307,FABIAN,"me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as"
105435,105436,Twelfth Night,108.0,5.1.308,FABIAN,your ladyship. I have your own letter that induced
105436,105437,Twelfth Night,108.0,5.1.309,FABIAN,"me to the semblance I put on, with the which I doubt"
105437,105438,Twelfth Night,108.0,5.1.310,FABIAN,"not but to do myself much right, or you much shame."
105438,105439,Twelfth Night,108.0,5.1.311,FABIAN,Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little
105439,105440,Twelfth Night,108.0,5.1.312,FABIAN,unthought of and speak out of my injury.
105440,105441,Twelfth Night,108.0,5.1.313,FABIAN,THE MADLY-USED MALVOLIO.'
105441,105442,Twelfth Night,109.0,5.1.314,OLIVIA,Did he write this?
105442,105443,Twelfth Night,110.0,5.1.315,Clown,"Ay, madam."
105443,105444,Twelfth Night,111.0,5.1.316,DUKE ORSINO,This savours not much of distraction.
105444,105445,Twelfth Night,112.0,5.1.317,OLIVIA,"See him deliver'd, Fabian, bring him hither."
105445,105446,Twelfth Night,112.0,,OLIVIA,Exit FABIAN

105448,105449,Twelfth Night,112.0,5.1.320,OLIVIA,"To think me as well a sister as a wife,"
105449,105450,Twelfth Night,112.0,5.1.321,OLIVIA,"One day shall crown the alliance on't, so please you,"
105450,105451,Twelfth Night,112.0,5.1.322,OLIVIA,Here at my house and at my proper cost.
105451,105452,Twelfth Night,113.0,5.1.323,DUKE ORSINO,"Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer."
105452,105453,Twelfth Night,113.0,,DUKE ORSINO,To VIOLA
105453,105454,Twelfth Night,113.0,5.1.324,DUKE ORSINO,"Your master quits you, and for your service done him,"
105454,105455,Twelfth Night,113.0,5.1.325,DUKE ORSINO,"So much against the mettle of your sex,"
105455,105456,Twelfth Night,113.0,5.1.326,DUKE ORSINO,"So far beneath your soft and tender breeding,"
105456,105457,Twelfth Night,113.0,5.1.327,DUKE ORSINO,"And since you call'd me master for so long,"
105457,105458,Twelfth Night,113.0,5.1.328,DUKE ORSINO,Here is my hand: you shall from this time be
105458,105459,Twelfth Night,113.0,5.1.329,DUKE ORSINO,Your master's mistress.
105459,105460,Twelfth Night,114.0,5.1.330,OLIVIA,A sister! you are she.
105460,105461,Twelfth Night,114.0,,OLIVIA,"Re-enter FABIAN, with MALVOLIO"
105461,105462,Twelfth Night,115.0,5.1.331,DUKE ORSINO,Is this the madman?
105462,105463,Twelfth Night,116.0,5.1.332,OLIVIA,"Ay, my lord, this same."
105463,105464,Twelfth Night,116.0,5.1.333,OLIVIA,"How now, Malvolio!"
105464,105465,Twelfth Night,117.0,5.1.334,MALVOLIO,"Madam, you have done me wrong,"
105465,105466,Twelfth Night,117.0,5.1.335,MALVOLIO,Notorious wrong.
105466,105467,Twelfth Night,118.0,5.1.336,OLIVIA,"Have I, Malvolio? no."
105467,105468,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.337,MALVOLIO,"Lady, you have. Pray you, peruse that letter."
105468,105469,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.338,MALVOLIO,You must not now deny it is your hand:

105472,105473,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.342,MALVOLIO,"And tell me, in the modesty of honour,"
105473,105474,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.343,MALVOLIO,"Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,"
105474,105475,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.344,MALVOLIO,"Bade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you,"
105475,105476,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.345,MALVOLIO,To put on yellow stockings and to frown
105476,105477,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.346,MALVOLIO,"Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people,"
105477,105478,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.347,MALVOLIO,"And, acting this in an obedient hope,"
105478,105479,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.348,MALVOLIO,"Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd,"
105479,105480,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.349,MALVOLIO,"Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,"
105480,105481,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.350,MALVOLIO,And made the most notorious geck and gull
105481,105482,Twelfth Night,119.0,5.1.351,MALVOLIO,That e'er invention play'd on? tell me why.
105482,105483,Twelfth Night,120.0,5.1.352,OLIVIA,"Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,"
