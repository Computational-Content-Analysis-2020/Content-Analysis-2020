    "# Week 1 - Counting Words & Phrases\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we take text corpora that we have developed, spidered, scraped, and encoded, and we find and count words, simple and parsed phrases and explore the statistical properties of those counts (e.g., word frequency distributions). Initially, we model how to search corpora for keywords or phrases. Next, we examine the distributions of terms and phrases across a corpus, and the correlation between different words and phrase counts. In order to do this effectively, we coarsely disambiguate words based of part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and normalize them through stemming and lemmatization. Next we distinguish *important* words and phrase within the corpus, and image them with Wordls! Then we calculate word frequenceis, conditional frequences (the frequency of word *shock* conditional on the presence of word *awe*), and statistically significant collocations of lengths 2 through $n$. Finally, we calculate and visualize Differences (Divergences and Distances) between the word frequency distributions from two corpora. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we shift to focus not simply on the *ideas* in a corpus, but also extracting precise *claims*. This process involves a sequential pipeline of classifying and structuring tokens from text, each of which generates potentially useful data for the content analyst. Steps in this process, which we examine in this notebook, include: 1) tagging words by their part of speech (POS) to reveal the linguistic role they play in the sentence (e.g., Verb, Noun, Adjective, etc.); 2) tagging words as named entities (NER) such as places or organizations; 3) structuring or \"parsing\" sentences into nested phrases that are local to, describe or depend on one another; and 4) extracting informational claims from those phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be introducing spaCy as a package for Computational Linguistics, and also walk you through how to use the Davies Corpora. \n",
    "\n",
    "While we wish to avoid using NLTK for heavy corpus analysis, some of its smaller functions can still be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, for final projects that draw on these tools, we encourage you to install the software on your own machines or shared servers at the university (RCC, SSRC) in order to perform these operations on much more text. \n",

    "\n",
    "First, \"def\" function literally defines a function. You can call the function that you defined by using the function name, which is, here, loadcorpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, it might be obvious, but, in Python, + operator is used when you combine literal strings or string variables. So, \"corpus_name\" + \"/\" gets you \"corpus_name/\". For example, in my case, the corpus_name is 'Users/hyunkukwon/Downloads/Movies'; so, corpus_name + \"/\" gives me '/Users/hyunkukwon/Downloads/Movies/'. By the way, why do we use \"\" here? This is because / is an operator in itself. Using \"\" makes / a string rather than an operator. Just to let you know, you can use type() to see what's the type of something. For example, if you write type(corpus_name), it'll get you 'string'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, the \"os.listdir\" function is used to get the list of files in the specified directory. So, here we're trying to get all the files in the directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "But we have some problems here: \n",
    "\n",
    "(1) first problem is that we do not want to load all the files in this directory; we want to load the files that have 'text' in the file name. So, we use the \"if corpus_style in file:\" to get the files that have the textual characteristics that we specified when we defined the function (corpus_style = \"text\"). Just to clarify, specifying the corpus_style does not get us the txt. files (in other words, it's not about the file extension). \n",
    "\n",
    "(2) second problem is that the files we have are zip files. So, we should unzip it so that we can get them on Python. That's why we use ZipFile, a class of zipfile module. We use ZipFile to read and write zip files. Then we use namelist() function, which returns the list of archive members by name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, append() function adds an item at the end of the list. Here, we make an empty list by doing \"texts_raw[file] = []\"; and then we open the file, get every line in the file, and then append it to the empty list. The for loop does the iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, we used something similar above: \"texts_raw = {}\". But they're different: {} is a dictionary, while [] is a list. "

Recall that $D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(P\\|Q)$ measures the amount of information loss when $Q$ is used to approximate $P$. Here, the rows are the $P$s used for calculating KL divergences, and the columns are the $Q$s. So, each cell measures the amount of information loss when the word distribution of the column text is used to approximate the word distribution of the row text. Because the KL divergence is directional, such that the divergence of $P$ from $Q$ is different from the same of $Q$ from $P$, the matrix is assymetric and contains unique information above and below the diagonal. The same is true for the $\\chi^2$ divergence."
