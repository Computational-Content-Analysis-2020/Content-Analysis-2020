    "# Week 3 - Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we shift from gathering human textual classifications through crowdsourcing, to using machine learning models and algorithms that train on those human classifications and extend them to documents far too numerous to read. If you recall, *clustering* allows us to stably partition text data (e.g., documents, turns of conversation) according to all patterns of covariation among available text features. *Classification*, by contrast, partitions text data according to only those features and their variation that enable us to mimic and extrapolate human annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will show how to use a variety of classification methods, including Naïve Bayes, Logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, decision trees and random forests, support vector machines and even a simple neural network, the perceptron. We will also demonstrate ensemble techniques that can link several such methods into a single, more accurate, classification pipeline. We will finally learn to use conventions and metrics to evaluate classifier performance on out-of-sample data. \n",

As you can see above, the TFVects, a document-term matrix, has 11349 columns, and this matrix is sparse, in the sense that it is comprised mostly of zeros. Dense matrices, in contrast, are the matrices that are comprised of mostly non-zeros. Then why do we make sparse matrices into dense ones? Because zero values don't contain important information but take up so much memory."

    "We include an example of a simple neural network, the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) that learns a function $f(\\cdot): R^m \\rightarrow R^o$ by training on a dataset, where $m$ is the number of dimensions for input and $o$ is the number of dimensions for output. Given a set of features $X = {x_1, x_2, ..., x_m}$ and a target $y$, it can learn a non-linear function approximator for either classification or regression. It is different from logistic regression, in that between the input and the output layer, there can be one or more non-linear layers, called hidden layers. The following figure shows a one hidden layer MLP with scalar output. ![title](../data/multilayerperceptron_network.png) The leftmost layer, known as the input layer, consists of a set of \"neurons\" $\\{x_i | x_1, x_2, ..., x_m\\}$ representing the input features (e.g., weighted words). Each neuron in the hidden layer transforms the values from the previous layer with a weighted linear summation $w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_mx_m$, followed by a non-linear activation function $g(\\cdot):R \\rightarrow R$ - like the logistic or hyperbolic tan function. The output layer receives the values from the last hidden layer and transforms them into output values."
